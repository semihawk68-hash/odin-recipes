    <img src="../images/cacio-e-pepe.jpg" alt="A bowl of cacio e pepe" width="300">

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>1 lb pici pasta , or other long pasta (450g)</li>
        <li>2.5 cups Pecorino Romano DOP, (200g)</li>
        <li>1 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ol>

        <li>Important - there are slightly different instructions depending on if you are using fresh or dried pasta. 
            Dried pasta must be cooked at step 3 and fresh pasta cooked at step 7. This is a very quick recipe, 
            read all instructions before starting.</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil (use less pasta water than you normally would so it's extra starchy). 
            Finely grate the pecorino and add it to a small mixing bowl, set aside.</li>
        <li>If using dried pasta start boiling it now making sure to undercook it by 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Put the freshly ground pepper in a large dry pan on a medium heat, toast the pepper for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>After a few seconds add ½ cup (roughly 120ml) of pasta water, let it simmer as the pasta is cooking.</li>
        <li>Add a few ladles of pasta water to the pecorino cheese just a little at a time until it has the 
            consistency of loose creamy paste ( a little thicker than heavy cream, it won’t be super smooth).</li>
        <li>If using fresh pasta start boiling it now.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is about 2 minutes away from being cooked, transfer it to the pan with the pepper 
            using tongs and stir it for about 1 minute to release more starch.</li>
        <li>Next, turn the heat down low and add the pecorino mixture. Stir it continuously until a smooth 
            and creamy cheese sauce is created. It will look like it's going to split at first but keep 
            stirring and it'll turn into a smooth and creamy sauce. Once you reach the saucy consistency 
            turn the heat off and keep stirring for 1 more minute to let it thicken. Serve.</li>

    </ol>
